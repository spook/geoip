# geoip
Simple GeoIP Address Lookup Tool

Dumps the geolocation information for an IP address.
Compact and verbose outputs are available.
This is just a wrapper around the Perl Geo::IP module;
there's nothing fancy or magical here.
I've written this so many times over and over, 
I finally made it "real".  

Here it is, I hope it saves you a few hundred keystrokes!
